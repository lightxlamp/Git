New

- (minus sign) functionality in VSC can be achieved by "git reset HEAD file_name_to_remove_from_staging_area"
  It was always there =P
  > Changes to be committed:
  > (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
            new file:   test-folder-to-ignore/some_unneeded_file.js
  ... No it is "restore", not reset and "git restore readme.md" did not work for me

New info:

- git add -p index.html - Partial adding. Will ask you about each part of change, whether iy should be added or not
